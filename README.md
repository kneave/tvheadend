# tvheadend
A Dockerfile to Build a TVHeadend Container from Source.

The docker container can be found at:
https://hub.docker.com/r/kneave/tvheadend/

It is build each time this repo is updated, typically I do so manually by updating the commit hash indicating what version of the source it is built from.
The latest build should map to the following hash in the tvheadend/tvheadend repo:
a9dffb7e96d5d0269840e40575e69ec996351ec1
